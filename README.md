## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate virtual environment**
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Install spaCy model**
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

6. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Create superuser (optional)**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Start Django server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
